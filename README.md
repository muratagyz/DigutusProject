User Login Feature for Web Application
Scenario:
Your are requested to design and implement user login and authentication feature for an
Internet facing web application. In addition to standard login, the users should be able to
register to the site using their name, surname, email and password. After entering these
information, a verification email should be sent to the user, containing the activation
code. Users are not allowed to login without entering their verification code after
registration. Also, there must be a mechanism for users to retrieve their passwords in case
they lose their passwords.

Site administrators should be able to access the following reports:
● How many users are online - How many new users are successfully registered within
a time period (e.g. 1 day)
● How many users are sent a verification code but did not register after 1 day
● How long it takes to complete login (in seconds, average for a given day)
